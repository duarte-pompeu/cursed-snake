History

Different versions recorded with asciinema, which unfortunately does not play too nice with lib curses.

# 1.0 (2015 replica)

This one works exactly like the 2015 version, which I created in Python 2 when I was studying Software Engineering and wanted to learn a bit about this language.

Fun fact: I was very curious about python and there were two non-python subjects which I completed and the following year they started teaching them in Python!

# 1.1 (2021)

It was surprisingly easy to change the code to add a new feature, considering it's 6 years old code from back when I was a newbie.

Some thoughts:

1. the abstractions are not that good, but the code is quite legible with good variable and function names
2. python tools are much more stable than web tools - I can barely run a site if I spend a couple of years away from it!
