# Platform / Terminal support

Unfortunately, curses support depends on the terminal used.

## Windows

Did not work using `git bash`.

Worked in VS Code, using a bash shell, and also on CMD. Simply run `make run`.

## Linux

Should work with most terminals.

History:

- 2015: develop the game while learning python 2.
- 2017: add the MIT license.
- 2021: port to python 3, manage packages with poetry and create a Makefile.
