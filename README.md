Snake game in a terminal window using python and curses

## Installing dependencies

This game requires **python2** and **ncurses** - it should work in any Unix-like system (Linux, OSX, *BSD, etc.). Probably requires Cygwin to play on Windows but I'm not sure


Arch Linux / Manjaro / etc...
```
yaourt -S python2 curses
```
