Snake game in a terminal window using python and curses

## Installing dependencies

This game requires **python2** and **ncurses** - it should work in any Unix-like system (Linux, OSX, *BSD, etc.). Probably requires Cygwin to play on Windows but I'm not sure

Download and play: 
```
curl -L  https://github.com/duarte-pompeu/snake/archive/master.zip > snake.zip; unzip snake.zip; cd ./snake-master/; chmod +x snake.sh; ./snake.sh
